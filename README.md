# AWS Projects Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey through Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each project builds on the previous one, starting from basic EC2 deployments to more advanced AWS solutions — showcasing my growth toward becoming a skilled Cloud/DevOps engineer.

## 🔧 Project Structure

Each project lives in its own folder with:
- A detailed `README.md` for that project
- Sample code/scripts (like `.sh`, `.html`, `.php` etc.)
- Screenshots when relevant
